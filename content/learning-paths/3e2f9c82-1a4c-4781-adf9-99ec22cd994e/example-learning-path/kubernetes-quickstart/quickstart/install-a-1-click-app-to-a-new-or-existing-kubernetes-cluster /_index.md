You can add a variety of preconfigured apps and stacks to a new or existing Kubernetes cluster.

1. Navigate to the Marketplace tab of your cluster in the [Kubernetes section of the control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/kubernetes/clusters).
2. Click Install in the Install Kubernetes 1-Click Apps section to install one of the recommended apps or search for an app in the search field.
Alternatively, locate the app you want to install in the [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/category/kubernetes) and click Install App on the upper right. Select whether to install the app on a new or existing cluster.
